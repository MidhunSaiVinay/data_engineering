# ingesting data

### Data Ingestion into Amazon Redshift

#### Introduction
To gain a competitive advantage, organizations must effectively store, process, and analyze vast amounts of data. Amazon Redshift is a cloud-based data warehouse solution designed for large-scale data analytics. Ingesting data into Redshift provides key benefits:

* **Scalability:** Scales to petabytes of data and tens of thousands of concurrent queries.
* **Performance:** Optimized for high-performance querying on large datasets.
* **Cost-Effectiveness:** Provides a cost-efficient solution compared to on-premises warehouses.
* **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with a wide range of AWS services and third-party tools.
* **Security:** Offers robust security features to protect data.

### Batch Data Ingestion

Batch data ingestion involves loading large volumes of data collected over a period into Amazon Redshift. The choice of service depends on data volume, format, transformation needs, and ingestion frequency.

#### Key AWS Services for Batch Ingestion:

* **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):**
    * **Function:** A highly scalable object storage service. It is the primary staging area for data to be loaded into Redshift.
    * **Use Case:** Ideal for loading large, structured, or semi-structured datasets (CSV, JSON, Parquet, Avro) from sources like retail stores' daily reports.
    * **Method:** Use the `COPY` command for efficient, parallel data loading from S3 into Redshift.

* **Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce):**
    * **Function:** A big data platform for processing vast amounts of data using frameworks like Apache Spark and Hadoop.
    * **Use Case:** Required for complex data transformations, cleaning, and enrichment *before* loading data into Redshift. For example, combining sales data with customer demographics to identify buying patterns.

* **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS):**
    * **Function:** A service for migrating databases to AWS with minimal downtime. The source database remains fully operational during migration.
    * **Use Case:** Migrating data from on-premises legacy databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) to Amazon Redshift. It supports continuous data replication to keep Redshift synchronized with the source.
    * **Automation:** DMS can automate schema generation, data type mapping, full loads, and incremental change data capture (CDC).

* **AWS Lambda:**
    * **Function:** A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events.
    * **Use Case:** Processing and transforming data in near real-time. It can be triggered by events, such as a new file arriving in an S3 bucket, to process the data and load it into Redshift. Useful for automating ingestion from APIs or IoT devices.

* **AWS Glue:**
    * **Function:** A fully managed, serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and data integration service.
    * **Use Case:** Discovering, preparing, and transforming data. AWS Glue crawlers can automatically infer schema from data in S3 and populate the AWS Glue Data Catalog. Glue jobs (using Python, Scala, or Java) can then perform complex transformations before loading the data into Redshift. It can be used as both a source and a target for ETL jobs.

### Streaming Data Ingestion

For real-time or near real-time analytics, data can be streamed directly into Amazon Redshift, bypassing the need to stage it in Amazon S3 first.

#### Key AWS Services for Streaming Ingestion:

* **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams:**
    * **Function:** A service for collecting and processing large streams of data records in real time.
    * **Method:** Amazon Redshift supports direct streaming ingestion from Kinesis Data Streams into a **materialized view**. This provides a low-latency pathway for real-time data. The materialized view acts as a landing area and can be refreshed to query the latest data.

* **Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka):**
    * **Function:** A fully managed service for Apache Kafka that makes it easy to build and run applications that use Kafka to process streaming data.
    * **Method:** Similar to Kinesis, Redshift can ingest streaming data directly from Amazon MSK into a materialized view for near real-time analytics.

#### Materialized Views for Streaming
When using streaming ingestion, the data lands in a materialized view. This view is a snapshot of the stream's data at a point in time. When refreshed, it pulls the latest data from the stream (Kinesis or MSK). This allows you to perform SQL transformations within Redshift and use existing BI tools for analysis.

### Data Movement and API Access

#### Moving Data between S3 and Redshift

* **`COPY` Command:** Loads data in parallel from files in an Amazon S3 bucket into a Redshift table. For optimal performance, data should be split into multiple compressed files.
    * **Syntax:** `COPY <table_name> FROM 's3://<bucket_name>/<object_prefix>' authorization;`

* **`UNLOAD` Command:** Unloads the results of a `SELECT` query from Redshift to one or more files in an S3 bucket. It operates in parallel by default for efficiency.
    * **Syntax:** `UNLOAD ('SELECT * FROM table') TO 's3://mybucket/unload/prefix_' iam_role '<role_arn>';`

#### Amazon Redshift Data API

* **Function:** A secure HTTP endpoint to interact with Amazon Redshift without configuring JDBC/ODBC drivers or managing persistent connections.
* **Use Cases:**
    * Accessing Redshift from serverless applications (e.g., AWS Lambda).
    * Running ad-hoc queries from notebooks (e.g., Amazon SageMaker) or IDEs.
    * Building ETL/ELT workflows and reporting systems.
* **Features:**
    * Asynchronous calls.
    * Authentication via IAM credentials or AWS Secrets Manager (no passwords in API calls).
    * Supports SQL commands (DML, DDL, `COPY`, `UNLOAD`), batch execution, and fetching results programmatically.

### Zero-ETL Integration

Zero-ETL is described as a no-code, cloud-native data integration platform that enhances AWS DMS by providing:
* **Automated Task Creation:** Automatically configures DMS tasks.
* **Visual Data Transformation:** Defines complex transformations with a no-code interface.
* **Orchestration and Scheduling:** Manages the entire data workflow.
* **Hybrid/Multi-Cloud Support:** Connects to a wide range of data sources.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:** Tracks task status and sends notifications.

## Quick Revision Notes

* **Goal:** Get a unified view of data in Amazon Redshift for analytics.

* **Batch Ingestion (Periodic Loads):**
    * **Staging Area:** **Amazon S3** is the primary location to store files before loading.
    * **Loading Command:** Use **`COPY`** to efficiently load data from S3 to Redshift.
    * **Complex Transformation:** Use **Amazon EMR** (with Spark/Hadoop) for heavy data processing *before* loading.
    * **Database Migration:** Use **AWS DMS** to move data from on-premises or other databases to Redshift with minimal downtime.
    * **Serverless ETL:** Use **AWS Glue** to discover schema (crawlers) and run transformation jobs.
