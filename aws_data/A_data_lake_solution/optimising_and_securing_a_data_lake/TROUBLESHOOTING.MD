# Troubleshooting

---
## AWS Glue Job Failures

* **Check Glue Job Logs**: Examine logs in Amazon CloudWatch for error messages and stack traces.
* **Verify Script Logic**: Review the ETL script for logical errors, incorrect transformations, or issues with data handling.
* **Check Resource Allocation**: Verify if the AWS Glue job has sufficient memory and compute resources (DPUs) allocated. Increase them if needed.
* **Check Dependencies**: Ensure that any upstream jobs or data sources that the failed job depends on have completed successfully and the data is available.
* **Verify Endpoints**: Ensure that any service endpoints (e.g., S3, database endpoints) the job connects to are healthy and accessible.

---
## Data Format Incompatibilities

* **Analyze Input Data**: Inspect the input data format, schema, and sample records to identify any incompatibilities with the transformation logic.
* **Review Transformation Code**: Verify if the transformation code can correctly handle the input data format, including any nested or complex structures.
* **Check Target Format**: Ensure the transformation is producing the expected output format for the target system.

---
## Data Quality Issues

* **Implement Data Quality Checks**: Add data validation and cleansing steps in the transformation logic to handle missing values, inconsistent formats, or corrupt records.
* **Periodically Evaluate Data Quality**: Use AWS Glue Data Quality to measure and monitor the quality of your datasets.
* **Implement Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms in the transformation code to gracefully handle data quality issues (e.g., moving problematic records to a dead-letter queue).

---
## Insufficient Permissions

* **Verify IAM Roles**: Confirm that IAM roles used by transformation jobs (e.g., AWS Glue service role) have the necessary permissions to access input data (e.g., S3 read), write to output locations (e.g., S3 write), and interact with required AWS services (e.g., AWS Glue API, KMS).
* **Review Resource Policies**: Ensure resource policies, such as S3 bucket policies or KMS key policies, are not denying access to the transformation jobs.
* **Check Lake Formation Permissions**: If using AWS Lake Formation, verify that the required permissions (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT` on tables; `USAGE` on databases; data location access) are granted for the IAM roles or users executing the jobs.

| :----------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Slow Data Processing** | **Analyze data ingestion**: Review the data ingestion process (e.g., AWS DMS, AWS DataSync) and identify bottlenecks. <br> **Optimize data storage**: Implement best practices like partitioning, compacting small files, and using columnar formats (e.g., Parquet, ORC) for better query performance. <br> **Use purpose-built data stores**: Consider services like Amazon Kinesis for real-time or high-velocity data. <br> **Rightsize resources**: Ensure compute resources (e.g., AWS Glue workers, EMR instances) are appropriately sized. <br> **Optimize your code and queries**: Review transformation logic and SQL queries for inefficiencies. <br> **Use monitoring tools**: Inspect the Spark UI (in AWS Glue and Amazon EMR) to understand processing flow and bottlenecks. |
| **Excessive Resource Consumption** | **Optimize storage**: Implement storage optimization techniques like compression, deduplication, and S3 Lifecycle policies. <br> **Rightsize resources**: Regularly review and adjust compute resources. Use auto-scaling capabilities (e.g., AWS Glue auto scaling, EMR managed scaling, Spark dynamic allocation). <br> **Use serverless services**: Explore AWS Glue, EMR Serverless, or Athena for cost-effective and scalable processing.                                                                                                                                  |

## Data Governance and Access Control Issues

* **Implement Data Cataloging**: Use AWS Lake Formation to create a centralized data catalog and set granular access controls for data and metadata.
* **Use Data Masking or Tokenization**: Implement techniques to protect sensitive data like Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
* **Review IAM Roles and Policies**: Regularly review and update IAM roles and policies to ensure least privilege access to data lake resources.
